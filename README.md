### A little about me and why I'm making Tadpole.js
I'm mostly a backend developer, but I do have a decent understanding of the front end. I know javascript pretty well,
but not nearly as well as I'd like to so I've decided to take the time and learn some of the newer JS libraries, because I'm building an Android and iOS application using PhoneGap. Before building Tadpole.js I looked around, but couldn't find a view loader that was templating system agnostic. If one already exists (which wouldn't surprise me) then at least I got to learn something new about javascript. 

### Requirements
Basic jQuery is required.

### What is Tadpole.js?
Tadpole.js is a simple library for injecting javascript views on demand. It could careless about what templating system you use or how you use the templating system.

### How does it work?
Tadpole.js maps easy to remember names to the javascript view files. Tadpole.js also injects the view as needed then renders the view for the user to interact with.

### Examples
I will have some examples up shortly.
